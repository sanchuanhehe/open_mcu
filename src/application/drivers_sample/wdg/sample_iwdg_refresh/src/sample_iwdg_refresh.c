  * @brief     IWDG module realize reset function sample
  * @details   The watchdog timeout reset function is used to set the time when the watchdog feeds the watchdog.
  *            When the window mode is enabled and the corresponding window value is set,
  *            an interrupt is generated when the count value is equal to the window value.
  *            When the watchdog is fed beyond the window value, a reset signal is generated.
  *            When the count value is 0 and the interrupt is not cleared, a reset signal is also generated.
  *            When the window mode is disabled, an interrupt is generated when the count value is reduced to half.
  *            The reset signal is generated only when the count value is 0 and the interrupt is not cleared.
